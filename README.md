Diabetes Prediction using SVM

This project utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on patient health metrics such as glucose level, BMI, and age. The dataset was preprocessed using standardization to ensure consistent feature scaling. The model achieves 78% accuracy on training data and 77% accuracy on test data
